This is one of the hardest aspects of data science project I have ever done. It didn't involve analysis, but trying to make the backend of data science work. 

In this project, I built a Django app with a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), PostgresQL.

Django is a high level full-stack open-source web framework written in Python, that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
