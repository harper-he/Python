Problem 1 - SAX Method<br>
Implement the SAX method in a programming language that you are comfortable with. Submit
your code. The input is a time series and the output is a string.<br>
Problem 2 - Weka and Apriori<br>
Load the supermarket.arff from the sample datasets provided by Weka in \/data" folder.<br>
 Report the top 10 rules with condence above 0.8.<br>
 Let f(c) denote the maximum minimum-support that allows you to nd rules with con-
dence c. Plot f(c) for condence values: c 2 f0:1; 0:2; : : : ; 0:9g (you can get this support
value by setting lower/upper bounds for support in Weka). What trend do you observe?<br>
Problem 3 - PageRank<br>
Calculate PageRank values for this graph<br>
Problem 4 - Collaborative Filtering<br>
Implement a movie rating prediction program for both item-based and user-based collaborative
ltering for the MovieLens 100k dataset available at
http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
Your program must take as input a user-item matrix (same format as u.data), the neigh-
borhood size, a user id 'u', and an item-id 'i' and should provide the predicted rating for both
user-based CF and item-based CF as output.<br>
Problem 5 - LoF<br>
Implement the local outlier factor method. Your method should provide the LoF score for any
instance in your dataset.
