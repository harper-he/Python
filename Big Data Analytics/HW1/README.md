This is homework 1 of Big Data Analytics course.

In this assignment, I did:

1. **Write a function** that receives a numpy array, python list, or tuple and starting at the 2nd from last element, returns every 3rd element of the list in reverse order. 
2. **Create a python class** that requires a single numpy array argument in its constructor, then Implement the **statistical methods** in the class to return the standard deviation, the min and max, the mean of the input. 
3. Create a function that takes as an argument the number of times to iterate a **monte-carlo simulation** of the **Monte Hall problem** with 4 doors and 1 prize. 
4. Create a numpy array and Plot a histogram of the data using matplotlib.
5. Write a function that **uses matplotlib to create a grid of scatter plots** of all combinatations of the columns in a pandas data frame. 
6. Count the total number of NAN values, total number of unique values in a **pandas data frame**. 
7. Use the pandas **groupby** feature
8. Create a function that takes as input 2 numpy single dimensional arrays and returns the **correlation coefficient** to the caller without using any built in numpy functions.

Thank you!
