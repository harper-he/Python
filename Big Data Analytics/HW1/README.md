This is homework 1 of Big Data Analytics course.

In this assignment, I did:

1. Write a function that receives a numpy array, python list, or tuple and starting at the 2nd from last element, returns every 3rd element of the list in reverse order. 
2. Create a python class that requires a single numpy array argument in its constructor, then Implement the statistical methods in the class to return the standard deviation, the min and max, the mean of the input.
