## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict if a loan will be charged off or not to help deter
unprofitable investments in high-risk notes. A charged off loan will result in a loss of both principal and interest for investors and harm the reputation and credibility of Lending Club. Our team is devoted to examining and finding some of the relevant factors to predict if the current loans would be
charged off to help avoid loss.
