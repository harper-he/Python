This is homework 3 of Big Data Analytics course.

In the first part of this assignment, we used “Moore’s Law” originated with a 1965 article in Electronics magazine that said the number of transistors in a given area would double every year to conduct the following tasks:

1. Read the txt file into a spark data frame
2. Data Cleanup: Drop columns,Drop rows that contain NaN vales 
3. Explore the data by plotting scatter plots. 
4. Compute the correlation between variables
5. add a log transform to the variables
6. train and test splits 
7. **Create a spark pipeline to perform linear regression**
8. Fit the pipeline 
9. Interpret the linear regression coefficient and Y intercept 
10. Compute mean squared error (MSE) using the transform method on fitted models.
11. predict

In the second part of this assignment, we used “global warming” txt file to conduct the following tasks:
1. create a pair plot of all the variables in a grid
2. Compute a correlation matrix 
3. describe why the better performing model made the model perform better.
4. Use the coefficients to gain insights into the global warming problem.
5. Describe inference conclusions.

Also, there is an optional question where I did:
1. implement a reduce method in the rdd class. 
2. Implement functions which return expected values.
